Update: I added some (more) random notes in regards to variants I got hold of.

If you are in the possession of the obfuscated powershell module "Mars" ([MARs.DEiMoS]) and find yourself confused how to decode it, here is how:

1) Locate the base64 part, found between "[sYsteM.ConVERT]::FROmbase64sTrING('" and ");For"
2) Paste the data into Cyber Chef
3) Pick "From Base64"
4) Locate the "-BXOR" part and take note of the variable starting with a dollar sign ($)
5) Locate the first occurrence and copy data between "<variable name>='" and "';"
6) In Cyber Chef, pick XOR and drop that recipe after the previous Base64 recipe
7) Add the newly copied data, into the field named "Key"
8) Pick "UTF8"
8) Bake
9) If you where successful there should be a visible "MZ" in the lower right side of the Cyber Chef GUI
10) You can now download the decoded sample DLL and continue your journey

The variants I came across seems to be two variants, so most "likely" an update was pushed during the infection period

- Variant 1: New-RB4
- Variant 2: RB5

- Each having:
  * It's own C&C IP
  * Unique RSA Key

Both did have the marker: solarmarker.dat

When decoded the DLL that would have been loaded in memory will be detected as (for example):  Win.Dropper.SolarMarker-9867952-0

- One "fun" part of a script "dropped" in conjunction contained the following:

It was actually several scripts dropped in conjunction, the difference being that where XOR:ed either "3" or "185" as the key as a different for the maRs.deImoS scripts.
