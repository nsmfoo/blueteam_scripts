If you are in the possession of the obfuscated powershell module "Mars" ([MARs.DEiMoS]) and find yourself confused how to decode it, here is how:

1) Locate the base64 part, found between "[sYsteM.ConVERT]::FROmbase64sTrING('" and ");For"
2) Paste the data into Cyber Chef
3) Pick "From Base64"
4) Locate the "-BXOR" part and take note of the variable starting with a dollar sign ($)
5) Locate the first occurrence and copy data between "<variable name>='" and "';"
6) In Cyber Chef, pick XOR and drop that recipe after the previous Base64 recipe
7) Add the newly copied data, into the field named "Key"
8) Pick "UTF8"
8) Bake
9) If you where successful there should be a visible "MZ" in the lower right side of the Cyber Chef GUI
10) You can now download the decoded sample DLL and continue your journey
